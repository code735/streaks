# Design Prompt (OpenCode Terminal UI)

Use this as a standing directive for all UI work in this repo.

## Core visual direction
- Build a terminal-first UI inspired by OpenCode.
- Dark-only theme. No light mode.
- Keep it minimal, dense, and focused; avoid playful UI.
- Use a mono-forward type feel with strong letterspacing for labels.

## Color + tone
- Backgrounds are deep charcoal with subtle layered gradients.
- Text is warm off-white; muted text is dusty warm gray.
- Accent uses a warm amber for active selection.
- Secondary accent can be soft teal for small indicators.
- Avoid purple, neon, or glossy treatments.

## Components
- Command palette: centered modal, soft border, subtle shadow, dense list rows.
- Selection row: amber highlight with dark text.
- Labels: uppercase, tracking, small size.
- Cards/panels: subtle borders, glassy but restrained.
- No rounded corners anywhere.

## Motion + interaction
- Minimal, purposeful transitions (hover lift, subtle fade/blur).
- No heavy animations; keep focus on text clarity.

## Layout
- Keep hierarchy clean: small uppercase label, strong title, muted helper text.
- Avoid large hero blocks; keep content compact and purposeful.

## Shortcuts
- Keep shortcut hints visible in a sticky bottom bar.
- Use a low-key, lowercase, compact font style similar to terminal status bars.
- Use kbd styling for key hints.

## Do nots
- No bright backgrounds or generic templates.
- No light mode toggles or theme switches.
- No decorative icons unless essential.
